 Abstract âˆ’ With the rapid growth of the online reviews and information conferred to us on daily basis, text classification has become crucial to maintain the information and to classify it. Such reviews on products, businesses, people can be helpful to customers as they can see any negative points about the products before they decide to purchase. In this paper, we have discussed a deep- learning method to leverage the existing opinionated content in order to offer better experience for customers to search about an entity.  Basically, Long Short-Term Memory are those learning networks that work best when there is sequence of data, exploiting this feature we have implemented LSTM model as text classifier. We have also used Word2vec model to get a distinctive view to the data. Word2vec attempts to understand meaning and relationship among words, converts words and phrases into a vector or numerical format. Based on the idea that word2vec will bring extra semantic feature that aids in text classification, our work incorporates word2vec model to classify the reviews and to obtain the numerical statistic to indicate how important a word is to an opinion document of a particular entity
